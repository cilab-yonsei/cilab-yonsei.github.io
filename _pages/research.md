# Research

The main topic of our research is to develop computational intelligence, which is the center of the interest in these days. Our essential objective is to understand the concept of computational intelligence and to design intelligent systems that is compatible in this field. For this purpose, our research focuses on various fields of research such as filtering, optimization, statistical machine learning and sensor fusion which leads to various kinds of application such as intelligent vehicle or robot. So far, we have developed a fair number of intelligent systems and contributed on the related fields by making artificial intelligence be more like human.
Currently, we are divided into three groups and each of them are in charge of a detailed research area.

[AREA I - Vehicular Application](#area-1)

[AREA II - Machine Vision](#area-2)

[AREA III - Mobile Robot Application](#area-3)

For more information on our research areas, please see below sections.
